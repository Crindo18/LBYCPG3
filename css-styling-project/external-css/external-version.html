    <h1>Invictus</h1>
    <h2>By William Ernest Henley</h2>

    <p class="stanza-1">
      Out of the night that covers me,<br />
      Black as the pit from pole to pole,<br />
      I thank whatever gods may be<br />
      For my unconquerable soul.
    </p>

    <p class="stanza-2">
      In the fell clutch of circumstance<br />
      I have not winced nor cried aloud.<br />
      Under the bludgeonings of chance<br />
      My head is bloody, but unbowed.
    </p>
 
    <p class="stanza-3">
      Beyond this place of wrath and tears<br />
      Looms but the Horror of the shade,<br />
      And yet the menace of the years<br />
      Finds and shall find me unafraid.
    </p>

    <p class="stanza-4">
      It matters not how strait the gate,<br />
      How charged with punishments the scroll,<br />
      I am the master of my fate,<br />
      I am the captain of my soul.
    </p>
